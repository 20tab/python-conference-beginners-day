EXERCISE:
If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your average time per mile?
What is your average speed in miles per hour? 
Hints: 
        - there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile);
        - convert time in seconds ... and then reconvert to the unit you need;
        - speed = distance/time

>>> 4/2
2.0
>>> 23**2  # Syntax for 23^2 
529

Tip:
If you have lines in the docstring (this string) that look like interactive
Python sessions, you can use the doctest module to run and test this code.

Try: python -m doctest -v math_operations.py

See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html

I stole this exercise.
