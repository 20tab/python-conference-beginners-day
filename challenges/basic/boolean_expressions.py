EXERCISE:
Given vars a and b float, print "a > b" if a greater than b 
else print "a <= b" if b is greater than or equal to a.

A Boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false. The following 
examples use the operator ==, which compares two operands and produces True if 
they are equal and False otherwise:
>>> 5 == 5
True
>>> 5 == 6
False
>>> 6 < 7
True
>>> 8 <= 2
False

The == operator is one of the relational operators; the others are:
    x!=y    # x is not equal to y
    x>y     # x is greater than y
    x<y     # x is less than y
    x>=y    # x is greater than or equal to y 
    x<=y    # x is less than or equal to y

HINT:
    - in python u have the elif statement that is an abbreviation of "else if"

Tip:
If you have lines in the docstring (this string) that look like interactive
Python sessions, you can use the doctest module to run and test this code.

Try: python -m doctest -v boolean_expressions.py

See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html
