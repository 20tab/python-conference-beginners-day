EXERCISES:
- Assign 3 variables 9 (a, b, c) with float numbers. Figure out the sum, the product, the 
difference and the quotient of the variables putting each operation in a new var.
- Assing 2 string vars one with "py" and one with "thon" try to apply math operation to this 2 vars. 

An assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values:

>>> message = 'And now for something completely different'
>>> n = 17
>>> pi = 3.1415926535897932

This example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string to a new variable named message; the second gives the integer 17 to n; the third assigns the (approximate) value of Ï€ to pi.

The type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to.
    
>>> type(message)
<class 'str'>
>>> type(n)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(pi)
<class 'float'>

Tip:
If you have lines in the docstring (this string) that look like interactive
Python sessions, you can use the doctest module to run and test this code.

Try: python -m doctest -v variables.py
