EXERCISES:
========================================================================================================================
Es.1
- Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints: 
Consider use range(#begin, #end) method


Es.2
Question:
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an 
integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
Consider use dict()


Es.3
Write a Python program to check whether a specified value is contained in a group of values.
Test Data : 
3 -> [1, 5, 8, 3] : True
-1 -> [1, 5, 8, 3] : False


Es.4
Write a Python program to print out a set containing all the colors from color_list_1 which are not present in 
color_list_2.
Test Data : 
color_list_1 = set(["White", "Black", "Red"]) 
color_list_2 = set(["Red", "Green"])
Expected Output : 
{'Black', 'White'}

Es.5
Write a Python program to add two objects if both objects are an integer type.
Hint: use isinstance built-in function to check the type of an objects
