# Python basic challenges

These challenges are aimed at people who've never learned Python.  
They're meant to tempt you to use the basic features of Python (ver 3.X), 
and encourage you to write your first "Pythonic" code...


# Python basic challenges in this repo

[The classic Hello World!](hello_word.py) - The print command, the first basic concept you have to know about Python.

[Python's syntax for math operations](math_operation.py)  - Python's syntax for math opera­tions is almost the same as standard mathematical notation. For example, the symbols +, - and / denote addition, subtraction and division, as you would expect. The symbol for multiplication is *.

[Variables](variables.py) - One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manip­ ulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value.

[Practice with Python interpreter](python_interpreter.md) - One of the benefits of working with an interpreted language is that you can test bits of code in interactive mode before you put them in a script.

[Boolean Expressions](boolean_expressions.py) - A Boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false.

[Lists](lists.py) - Like a string, a list is a sequence of values. In a string, the values are characters; in a list, they can be any type.

[Strings](string_operations.py) - Strings are amongst the most popular types in Python. We can create them simply by enclosing characters in quotes. Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes.

[loops and range function](forloop_range.py) - We often want computers to repeat some process several times. Programming languages provide structures that enable you to repeat blocks of instructions over and over again. This type of repetition is known as iteration.

[Dictionaries](dictionaries.py) - You can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are called keys) and a set
of values.

[Functions](functions.py) - In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation.



# Beyond Python - learning to use third party libraries

Check out the great tutorials at [newcoder.io](http://newcoder.io/) and learn how to use:

* Matplotlib to plot charts
* GEOJson to parse geographical data
* requests to get data off the internet
* scrapy for web scraping
* postgres as a database
* Tk for graphics and GUI stuff

and lots more...
