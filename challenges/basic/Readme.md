# Python basic challenges

These challenges are aimed at people who've never learned Python.  
They're meant to tempt you to use the basic features of Python (ver 3.X), 
and encourage you to write your first "Pythonic" code...


# Python basic challenges in this repo

[The classic Hello World!](hello_word.py) - The print command, the first basic concept you have to know about Python.

[Python's syntax for math operations](math_operation.py)  - Python's syntax for math opera­tions is almost the same as standard mathematical notation. For example, the symbols +, - and / denote addition, subtraction and division, as you would expect. The symbol for multiplication is *.

[Variables](variables.py) - One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manip­ ulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value.

[Practice with Python interpreter](python_interpreter.md) - One of the benefits of working with an interpreted language is that you can test bits of code in interactive mode before you put them in a script.

[Boolean Expressions](boolean_expressions.py) - A Boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false.

[loops and range function](forloop_range.py) - We often want computers to repeat some process several times. Programming languages provide structures that enable you to repeat blocks of instructions over and over again. This type of repetition is known as iteration.

[The Game of Life](life.md) - a programming classic.  Try it out using OO and functional paradigms in Python.



# Beyond Python - learning to use third party libraries

Check out the great tutorials at [newcoder.io](http://newcoder.io/) and learn how to use:

* Matplotlib to plot charts
* GEOJson to parse geographical data
* requests to get data off the internet
* scrapy for web scraping
* postgres as a database
* Tk for graphics and GUI stuff

and lots more...
