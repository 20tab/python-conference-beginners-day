# The beginner mentor's oath


*The crowd at the registration desk gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall
not end until the end of the sprints . I shall speak no jargon, feign no
surprise, well no actuallys, and avoid all subtle isms.  I will remember what
it was like to be a beginner. I shall wear no crowns and seek no glory in
geeking out with all my conference mates, and instead will drop anything at a
moment's notice to help any beginner with sympathy, patience and a smile. I
shall live and die at my post. I am the mentor in the darkness. I am the
friendly coach on the walls. I am the gateway drug for new happy programmers. I
pledge my life and honor to the Beginners Watch, for this day, and all the
scheduled conference days to come.*
